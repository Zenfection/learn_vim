# Command - `e`

> Moving by end of word with `e`

The `e` command allows you to move end of word by end of word in normal mode.

You can remember it by associating the `e` with *end* of word.

## Exercise 01  - Intro to Ends

The goal of the first exercise is to teach you the `e` command.

1. Start with the cursor on the first line
2. Use the `e` command to move end of word by end of word until the end of the line.
3. Repeat for the second line.

Keep an eye on the cursor. See how it skips spaces?

See how it moves with punctuation, like, commas and!? Other stuff??

### Tips

- As you become familiar with both `w` and `e`, you'll learn when to use one vs. the other.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `e` key. For me, I use my left middle finger.

## Exercise 02 - How Many Words?

1. Look at the line with the symbols and guess how my times you will hit `e` to move from the "." to the "@".
2. Write down your guess.
3. Move the cursor to 41, use the `e` command and count the result.
4. Write down the result.
5. After, Repeat Steps 3, but prefix the `e` command with the result (e.g. `1e`).

Guess:

. ! & ? js # *$% ^ & @

Result:

### Tips

- Are you noticing a pattern? With certain commands, like `e` and `w`, you can prefix with `n` where `n` is a number. Keep that in mind!

## Exercise 03  - Fix the PR

The goal of the third exercise is to continue practicing the `e` command.

You're about to submit a PR for that feature you just built. But you realize, it has some typos. Can you find and fix them?

1. Use the `e` command to navigate through the markdown and fix the typos.

### Tips

- `e` shines when you need fix typos/characters at the end of words.

## Exercise 04 - Bad JS

The goal of the fourth exercise is to practice using the `e` command in the context of code.

Not again! More typos in your coworker's JavaScript? If only there were a tool to fix these. For now, can you use your Vim skills to fix them?

1. Fix the typos in the JavaScript code block below using the `e` command to move around.

```javascript
const personnn = {
    name: "",,
    type: "humann",
    favColor: "bluee",
}

let { namee } = person;;;
```

### Tips

- This might be used more often than the `w` command so learn it well!

## Exercise 05 - Reviewing

The goal of the fifth exercise is to reflect on what commands you know so far.

Oh no! A virus affected our text file again by adding random "~"s mixed throughout it. Can you remove them?

1. Start with the cursor on the first line.
2. Use the `e` command to move to the "~".
3. Ex-out the "~" with the `x` command.
4. Repeat until you remove all "~".

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, think about these questions and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

- What is the `e` command used for?
- In which mode do you use it?
- How is it different compared to the `w` command?
