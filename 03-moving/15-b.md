# Command - `b`

> Moving backwards with `b`

The `b` command allows you to move backwards, word by word in normal mode.

A good way to remember it is `b` for *back-words*.

## Exercise 01  - Backwards Reading

The goal of the first exercise is to introduce you to the `b` command.

1. Start with the cursor on the first line.
2. Hit the `A` command to go to the end.
3. Hit `esc`.
4. Use the `b` command to move backwards and read the sentence.

### Tips

- `b` the b is a more efficient way to go left (as opposed to `h` which can be slow). Know when to use each!
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `b` key. For me, I use my right index finger.

## Exercise 02 - ?Words Many How

The goal of the second exercise is to learn how you can combine `b` with numbers.

1. Look at the symbols again and guess how my times you will hit `b` to move from the "." to the "A".
2. Write down your guess after "Guess:".
3. Move the cursor to the line with symbols and use `b` to move backwards.
4. Add the result after "Result:".
5. After, Repeat Steps 3, but prefix the `b` command with the result (e.g. `1b`).

### Tips

- Similar to `w`, combining with a number like `2` can move you backwards 2x as fast.

## Exercise 03  - Fix the Docs

The goal of the third exercise is to practice moving quickly with the `b`.

We're releasing our API docs tomorrow, but no one checked for typos! We need this done soon. Can you double-check them for typos?

1. Start at the end of the markdown block on the double-exclamation.
2. Use the `x` to remove typos and the `b` to move backwards.
3. Fix all the typos

### Tips

- Speed will come with time!

## Exercise 04 - Function the Fix

The goal of the fourth exercise is to use the `b` command with some JavaScript code.

Your function looks a little funny, no? Can you fix the typos?

1. Start with the cursor on Line 97.
2. Use the `b` command to move from the bottom of the function to the top.
3. Fix the typos.

```javascript
function buildDogg(name) {
    rreturn {
        nname,
        type:: "caninee",
        breed:: "goldenn",
    }
}
```

### Tips

- Be mindful of the cursor position as you move from the bottom upwards.

## Exercise 05 - Reviewing

The goal of the fifth exercise is to reflect on what commands you know so far.

Oh no! Another virus affected our text file by adding random "~"s mixed throughout it. Can you remove them?

1. Start with the cursor at the end of the first line.
2. Use the `b` command to move to the "~".
3. Ex-out the "~" with the `x` command.
4. Repeat until you remove all "~".

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, answer these questions out loud and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

- What is the `b` command used for?
- In which mode do you use it?
- When should you use `b` vs. `w` vs. `e`?
