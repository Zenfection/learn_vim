# Command - `w`

> Moving by word with `w`

The `w` command allows you to move word by word in normal mode.

You can remember it by thinking `w` for *word*.

## Exercise 01  - Intro to Words

The goal of the first exercise is to teach you the `w` command.

1. Start with the cursor on the first line.
2. Use the `w` command to move word by word until you hit the end of the sentence.
3. Repeat for the second line.

Keep an eye on the cursor as you move down the sentence.

Notice. What happens with punctuation? Is it, what, you expected?

### Tips

- The idea of what constitutes a "word" might be different than what you expect. Keep that in mind as you're practicing.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `w` key. For me, I use my left ring finger.

## Exercise 02 - How Many Words?

In the second exercise, the goal is to learn how you can combine the `w` command with a number and see what counts as a "word."

1. Look at the line with the punctuation and words. Guess how my times you will hit `w` to move from the "." to the "A".
2. Write down your guess after "Guess:".
3. Move the cursor to the line, use the `w` command and count the result.
4. Add the result on to "Result:".
5. After, Repeat Steps 3, but prefix the `w` command with the result (e.g. `1w`).

Guess:

. ? & * hello #$% ^& A

Result:

### Tips

- See how you can use `nw` where `n` is the number of times you want to hit the `w` command? Similar to the multiple line insert with `o` and `O`! Pretty cool, huh?

## Exercise 03  - Letter to Manager

The goal of this third exercise is to start to incorporate the `w` command with how you might combine it with `n`, as in a number, along with the other commands we've learned so far.

You wrote a draft to your manager about these exercises, but you left a few typos. Can you fix them before you send them this message?

1. Start with the cursor on Line 67.
2. Hit `2w` then `x` to delete the extra comma.
4. Hit `o` to insert a new line below.
5. Hit `esc`.
6. Use the rest of your skills to fix the remaining typos and missing line breaks.

Dear Manager,,

Thank you for buying mee these Vim exercises to improve my skills. You have no idea how fast I am learning. My ability to move through text files is lightning fast now.

Can't wait to show you in our next 1:1.
- Your Faavorite EEmployee

### Tips

- By now, you should feel comfortable switching between normal mode and insert mode with `esc`. If you haven't remapped caps lock to `esc`, let this be another reminder!

## Exercise 04 - Fix the Function

The goal of the fourth exercise is to see how the `w` command might be used when writing JavaScript.

Your function has a few typos in it. Can you fix them?

1. Start with the cursor on Line 90.
2. Use the `w` command to move through the function.
3. Fix the three typos (extra letters).

```javascript
function buildPerson(name) {
    return {
        nname,
        type: "hhuman",
        favColor: "rred",
    }
}
```

### Tips

- Get comfortable using the `w`, `I` and the `A` commands to get the cursor where you need to be the fastest. Over time, it will become second nature for your fingers.

## Exercise 05 - Reviewing

The goal of the fifth exercise is to reflect on what commands you know so far.

Oh no! A virus affected our text file by adding random "~"s mixed throughout it. Can you remove them?

1. Start with the cursor on the first line.
2. Use the `w` command to move to the "~".
3. Ex-out the "~" with the `x` command.
4. Repeat until you remove all "~".

<!-- Text for exercise starts

- `h` moves left toward ~the *house*
- `j` ~moves down (*jumping* off a ledge)
- `k` moves up (*kicking* a soccer ball upward)
- `l` moves ~right (*left*to right, like English)
- `i` lets me *insert* text
- `a` ~lets me insert text *after* the cursor
- `I` lets me *Initially* insert text
- `A` lets ~me *Append* text
- `x` lets me ~*ex-out* a character
- `r` lets me ~*replace* a character
- `o` ~inserts a line below the *original* line
- `O` inserts ~a line *Over* the current line
- `w` moves ~word by word

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, think about these questions and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

- What is the `w` command used for?
- In which mode do you use it?
- How is punctuation treated? The same or different as a typical word?
