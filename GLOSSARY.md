# Glossary

This is a handy-dandy glossary for you to use when you forget what a term means.
Feel free to modify and add your own spin to the definitions!

- **command**: a key on the keyboard that does something while in normal mode. For example, hitting the `h` command in normal mode will move the cursor left.
- **normal mode**: the "default" mode in Vim. You're usually in this mode whenever you're navigating or modifying text.
- **insert mode**: whenever you hit a character on the keyboard, and it shows up on the screen, you're probably in insert mode. This is the free mode. A good way to tell if you're in normal mode vs. insert mode is to look at the status near the bottom of the screen. You'll see "--INSERT--" or "--NORMAL--" usually. The other way is to hit the command `h`. If your cursor moved left, you're in normal mode. If it entered "h" into the file you're in, then you're in insert mode.
- **motion**: a character that you use with another command to create a combination. In the example `dt"`, the `d` is the command and the `t"` makes up the motion, which together stand for "till the double-quote".
- **touch-typing**: the ability to use muscle memory to find keys, or to type without looking.
- **visual mode**: the mode you use to "mark" or select text using `v` from normal mode.
