# Command - `j`

> Navigating down with `j`

`j` is another command that is part of the fundamental commands in Vim. You use it for basic navigation while in normal mode.
It allows you to move down.

A good way to remember is to think of the word *jump*. When you jump from a ledge or down steps, you are heading downward. With Vim, we can use `j` to *jump* down the editor.

## Exercise 01  - Learn to Jump

In this first exercise, the goal is to teach our fingers how to move down using the `j` command.

1. Start with the cursor on the top of the ⬇️.
2. Use the `j` command to move down.
3. Complete the exercise by stopping on the 🌊.

### Tips

- Same as with the `j`, you can hold down the command to move faster.
- If the jump mnemonic doesn't resonate with you, come up with your own for remembering that `j` means to move downward.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `j` key. For me, I use my right index finger.

## Exercise 02 - Jumping Over the Mountain

For the second exercise, the goal is to practice moving in small steps from A to B. We want our muscle memory to associate `j` with downward movement.

In the exercise, we're going to jump over mountains and land in the ocean.

1. Click on the ⬇️ on first line and put your cursor there.
2. Use the `j` command to move down.
3. Pass the mountain 🏔️ and stop when you hit the 🌊.
4. Follow Steps 1-3 for the remaining lines.

### Tips

- Get used to switching between tapping the key a lot and a little to land on the right spot with accuracy.

## Exercise 03  - Skating through Trees

In this exercise, we're combining what we learned in the last exercise (the `h` command) with what we're learning now. This time, you're moving more quickly.

You're riding a skateboard back home, but the road you're on has a bunch of trees. Don't run into them!

1. Start with your cursor on the skateboard 🛹.
2. Use the `j` and `h` commands to get home 🏠.

### Tips

- Get used to using the two commands `h` and `j` together. Eventually, you'll be able to move wherever with commands so it's important you master these early on.

## Exercise 04 - Watch out for the Cat!

The goal of this exercise is to continue using the `j` and `h` commands together. Focus on small movements and remind yourself which command does what.

Your friends told you not to head down Purrful Lane, but you didn't listen! The street is full of cats. Make sure you don't hit any on your way home!

1. Start with your cursor on the skateboard 🛹.
2. Use the `j` and `h` commands to get home 🏠.

### Tips

- Don't blindly hit the keys. Say them as you move! This will force you to go slower, but also strengthen the association between the command and the movement.
  - "`j`, `j`, `h`..."

## Exercise 05 - Smooth Skating

By this point, you should feel comfortable using the `j` command in combination with the `h` command.

Send yourself home by skating past the cat and getting home.

1. Start on the skateboard 🛹.
2. Get home 🏠!

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, think about these questions and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

If you're able to, do it out loud. It shouldn't take more than 1-2 mins.

- What is the `j` command used for?
- How are you going to remember it?
- In which mode do you use it?
- How is the `j` command different from the `h` command?
- How can the two commands be used together?
