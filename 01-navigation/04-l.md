# Command - `l`

> Navigating right with `l`

`l` is the last of the fundamental commands when it comes to navigation in Vim. Like the others, it is used while in normal mode.
It allows you to move right.

To remember this, I think about the phrase "left to right", which is how we write in English. The "l" in the word "left" tells me that `l` in Vim moves to the right. Hence `l` = *left* to right.

*Note: this will be the last exercise where we only use emojis. The remaining exercises will focus more on real-world scenarios.*

## Exercise 01  - Head to the Tree

The goal of the first exercise is to get our finger used to the `l` command.

1. Start with the cursor on top of the right arrow ➡️.
2. Use the `l` command to move right.
3. Complete the exercise by stopping on the 🌲.

### Tips

- Try holding down the `l` command. Notice how fast you move!
- Think of an association you can make to help you remember the `l` command. Mine is the "left to right" and the image I think of is a hand writing an essay.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `l` key. For me, I use my right ring finger.

## Exercise 02 - Read the Newspaper

For the second exercise, the goal is practice moving in small steps from A to B. We want to build up the muscle memory without losing accuracy.

In this scenario, we're moving our eyes from *left* to right as we read the newspaper. As we turn the page, we read more and more and the distance from where we started reading to where we are grows.

1. Click on the eyes 👀 on the first line to put the cursor there.
2. Use the `l` command to move left.
3. Stop once you hit the newspaper 📰.
4. Follow Steps 1-3 for the remaining lines.

### Tips

- It shouldn't feel too hard. We're intentionally keeping it simple.

## Exercise 03  - Your Pets Escaped!

The goal of this exercise is to practice using the `h` and `l` commands together.

You were inside practicing Vim for VSCode when you look out the window to realize that your cat, dog and fish have all escaped! Bring them back!

1. Start on the open-mouth face 😮.
2. Go to each pet, stop to pick them up.
3. Bring them back to the house 🏠.

### Tips

- Be mindful of the direction in which the command moves. It's easy to blindly hit keys. Instead, talk out loud as you move, "I have Puffer the fish. Now I'm moving right with `l` to head back to the house."

## Exercise 04 - Into the Net

The goal of the fourth exercise is to practice using the `j`, `k`, and `l` commands together.

We're back at soccer practice again. This is a simple drill. Dribble the soccer ball around those x's and shoot it into the net.

1. Start with the cursor on the soccer ball ⚽.
2. Use the commands you know to dribble up, to the right and into the net.

### Tips

- If you're feeling confident, move onto the next round. If you want more practice, do this exercise again.

## Exercise 05 - Pets on the Loose!

This final exercise brings together what you've learned so far. Use the `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` commands to complete this challenge.

You were at the skatepark. Your friend called. They said your pets got out again. Pick them up and bring them home!

1. Start at the skateboard 🛹.
2. Avoiding the x's, pick up all 3 pets and bring them home 🏠.

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, think about these questions and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

If you're able to, do it out loud. It shouldn't take more than 1-2 mins.

- What is the `l` command used for?
- How are you going to remember it?
- In which mode do you use it?
- What commands have you learned so far?
