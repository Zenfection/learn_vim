# Command - `f`

> Finding text with `f`

The `f` command is used to find text in a line. It is used while in normal mode.

A good way to remember it is to think `f` for find.

## Exercise 01  - Find the Money

The goal of the first exercise is to introduce you to the `f` command.

Find all the $ in the text.

1. Start at the beginning of the line.
2. Hit `fx` where `x` is replaced by the character you're looking for.
3. To go to the next one, repeat the same command.
4. Find all occurrences of "$".

Within this sentence, there is $. Multiples bags of $. Can you find all of them? $

### Tips

- Occasionally, this is more efficient than moving with `w` or `e` when looking for text.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which finger you're using to hit the `f` key. For me, I use my left index finger.

## Exercise 02 - JavaScript Changes

The goal of the second exercise is to continue practicing the `f` command.

There are a few minor changes to be made in your JavaScript program. Can you help me?

1. Start on the first line.
2. Find the 1 and change that to be 5.
3. Find the 2 and change that to be 5.
4. Find the word "same" and change that to "equal".

<!-- Text for exercise starts -->

```javascript
const x = 1;

const y = 2;

const isEqual = x === y ? "They're same!" : "They're not equal!";
```

### Tips

- Observe what happens when you try to use the `f` command on a line different than the one that contains what you're looking for.

## Exercise 03  - Moving Quickly

The goal of the third exercise is to practice the `f` command and move quickly.

We need to refactor this JavaScript code below. Follow the instructions and make use of the `f`. For fun, [time yourself](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch) the first round. Then, go a second round and see if you can beat your original time.

1. Change "greeting" to "greetPerson".
2. Find the () and add the word "name" inside as a parameter.
3. Find the `}` inside the backticks and add an exclamation point after.
4. Add the missing ";" at the end of the return statement (after the last back-tick).

<!-- Text for exercise starts -->

```javascript
function greeting() {
    return `Hello there, ${name}`
}
```

### Tips

- Don't worry if you feel slow now. You will increase your speed with practice.

## Exercise 04 - No Capitals

The goal of the exercise is to continue practicing the `f` command in a new scenario.

Oh no! This text is corrupt. There shouldn't be any capital letters. Can you fix it?

1. Use `fx` to move throughout the text.
2. Find all capital letters (e.g. "H", "R", etc).
3. Replace with lowercase or delete if they are extra.

### Tips

- Remember, use `fx` where `x` can be anything (letters, capital letters, symbols, etc.)!

## Exercise 05 - Reviewing

The goal of the fifth exercise is to review everything you've learned so far.

The commands we had have been littered with $. Can you remove these?

1. Start from the top.
2. Use the `f$` to move throughout the text and remove them with `x`.
3. Find and remove them all.

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, answer these questions out loud and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

- What is the `f` command used for?
- In which mode do you use it?
- How would you use it to find an "@" symbol in a line?
