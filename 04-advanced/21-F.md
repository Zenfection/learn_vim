# Command - `F`

> Finding text behind with `F`

The `F` command is the same as the `f` command, expect it looks in the opposite direction - backwards.

A good way to remember the `F` command is to think, "**F**! I am driving backwards on a one-way street!".

## Exercise 01  - Fixing Typos

The goal of the first exercise is to familiarize yourself with the `F` command.

Fix all the typos in the sentence.

1. Start at the end of the line.
2. Hit `Fx` to find backwards the first typo ("u" in "Vum").
3. Fix it.
4. Use the same command to continue working backwards until you've fixed all the typos.

### Tips

- It's easy to get `f` and `F` mixed up so remind yourself of the mnemonic for remembering `F`.
- Look down at your fingers briefly to identify which fingers you're using to hit the `F` key. For me, I use my left pinky finger to hit `shift` and my left index finger to hit `f` to make `F`.

## Exercise 02 - Minor Changes

The goal of the second exercise is to continue practicing the `F` command.

Someone changed your JavaScript program. Now, you need to make a few minor adjustments.

1. Start on the last line.
2. Find "${fromPlanet}" and add an ! to the end of.
3. Find "goodbyeEarth" and change to "goodbyePlanet".
4. Find "from" and change to "fromPlanet".
5. Find "hello" and change to "goodbye".

```javascript
let goodbye = "hello";

let from = "Earth";

let goodbyeEarth = `${goodbye}, ${fromPlanet}`;
// Goodbye, Earth!
```

### Tips

- Getting comfortable with the `F` will come over time as you use it more.

## Exercise 03  - Moving Quickly Backwards
The goal of the third exercise is to practice the `F` command and move quickly.

This is the same exercise from `f`. This time, we're starting from the bottom and moving upwards. [Time yourself](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch) the first round. Then, go a second round and see if you can beat your original time. Compare your times to your times where you used `f`.

1. Start from the bottom (Line 74), with the cursor at the end of the line.
2. Add the missing ";" at the end of the return statement (after the last back-tick).
4. Find the `}` inside the backticks and add an exclamation point after.
5. Find the () and add the word "name" inside as a parameter.
6. Change "greeting" to "greetPerson".

```javascript
function greeting() {
    return `Hello there, ${name}`
}
```

### Tips

- Speed comes with time!

## Exercise 04 - No Lowercase

The goal of the fourth exercise is to continue practicing the `F` command in a new scenario.

The text is corrupt and we need you to come in and fix it. There shouldn't be any lowercase letters. Can you use your `F` magic and fix it?

1. Start from the last line, at the end of the line.
2. Use the `Fx` to move throughout the text.
3. Find all lowercase letters (e.g. "a", "i", etc).
4. Replace with capitals or delete if they are extra.

### Tips

- Remember, the `x` in `Fx` is the same as the `x` in `fx`. It can be any character you want.

## Exercise 05 - Reviewing

The goal of the fifth exercise is to review everything you've learned so far.

Someone has infiltrated our text and added a bunch of @ symbols. Can you fix this?

1. Start from the bottom, at the end of the line.
2. Use the `F@` to climb backwards through the text, removing the `@` with `x` as you go.
3. Find and remove them all.

### Reflecting

Reflecting on what you've learned so far, answer these questions out loud and pretend you're explaining them to someone who is new to Vim.

- What is the `F` command used for?
- In which mode do you use it?
- How does it differ from the `f` command?
